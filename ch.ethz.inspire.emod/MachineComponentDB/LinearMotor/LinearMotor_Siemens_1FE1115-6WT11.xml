    Model parameter definition
    ==========================
      Model : Linearmotor 
      Type  : Siemens_1FE1115-6WT11
    Parameters
    ----------
      PowerNominal [W]
        Nominal mechanical power of motor.
      RotspeedNominal [rpm]
        Nominal rotational speed of motor.
      PowerSamples [W]
        Power samples used for linear interpolation of the efficiency.
        The PowerSamples must be sorted, smallest value first.
      RotspeedSamples [rpm]
        Rotational speed samples used for linear interpolation of the efficiency.
        The RotspeedSamples must be sorted, smallest value first.
      EfficiencyMatrix [1]
        The matrix value at the position p,r (EfficiencyMatrix[p,r])
        corresponds to the motor efficiency when the motor is running
        at power PowerSamples[p] and at rotational speed RotspeedSamples[r].
